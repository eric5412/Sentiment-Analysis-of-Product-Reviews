Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
================
### Introduction:
The scope of this project was to analyze Amazon Alexa product data to gain insights from reviews provided by customers. The analysis was done using Python.

* **Data Source:** Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews/#).


The first goal was to analyze the data to discover what was the most frequent rating, what was the overall customer sentiment,
and which product variations had the most reviews and the least reviews.

The second goal was to use Natural Language Processing to analyze the sentiment of the reviews,
to discover what the customers liked from the products, and to learn about what the customers
may have wanted improvements on. Analyzing customer sentiment is important,
because it allows a company to build upon business strategies and improve the experience of 
their customers.
**Data Source:** Advertising dataset from [An Introduction to
Statistical
Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-first-edition).
